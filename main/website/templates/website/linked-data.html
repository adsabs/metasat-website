                <p><i>Written by: <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1468-5373">Allie Tatarian</a></i></p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/"><b>R</b>esource <b>D</b>escription <b>F</b>ramework</a>, or RDF, is a data model that is used to describe metadata on the web. RDF stores metadata in machine-readable "semantic triples" that are each made up of a subject, a predicate, and an object, much like a natural language sentence. However, RDF triples work a little bit differently than natural languages. For example, in the sentence "My car is silver," the subject is "my car," the predicate is "is," and the object is "silver." As a human reading that sentence, you know that I am telling you the color of my car, but this isn't obvious to a machine&mdash;the word "is" can mean a lot of things! An RDF triple that holds the same information might look like: "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">My car (subject)</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">has color (predicate)</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">silver (object)</span>." This combination of subject, predicate, and object holds more meaning to a machine because you are explicitly telling it that you are talking about color.</p>

                <p>RDF can be written in several different syntaxes, many of which clearly store information in triples. You can also store semantic triples in JSON-LD, which is very similar to <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> syntax (in fact, <em>all valid JSON-LD is also valid JSON</em>). It is convenient to store information in JSON syntax because it is easy for computers to read and understand data that is structured. Both JSON and JSON-LD store information in key-value pairs. For example, storing information about color in JSON syntax would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "color": "silver"
}</code></pre>

                <p>In JSON syntax, the first concept ("color") is called the key, and the second concept ("silver") is the value. But how do we get from semantic <i>triples</i> to key-value <i>pairs</i>? An easy way is to use JSON's nesting capabilities:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "myCar": {
        "color": "silver"
    }
}</code></pre>

                <p>Now, even though "myCar" and "color" are both keys, "myCar" acts as the subject and "color" as the predicate. (There is another way to create triples using JSON-LD using the <code>@id</code> term. This is explained a few paragraphs down.)</p>

                <p>JSON-LD helps us make this syntax even more machine-friendly by using <b>U</b>niform <b>R</b>esource <b>I</b>dentifiers (URIs). A URI can act as a unique, machine-readable and web-friendly identifier for an item or resource. To make proper machine-readable linked data, at least the predicate keys should use URIs. In this case, a good URI to use for the idea "has color" is https://schema.org/color. This is a good URI because it provides the program with both a unique, permanent identifier for the idea and a definition of the concept ("The color of the product.").</p>

                <p>JSON-LD uses a special section called the <code>@context</code> section to define how human-readable keys can be <a href="/resources/advanced#expansion">expanded</a> into machine-readable URIs. One especially useful concept that can be used in the <code>@context</code> is <code>@vocab</code>. This concept defines the base vocabulary of the file. Most keys will expand so that they are concatenated to the end of the URI specified by <code>@vocab</code>. In the following example, the <code>@context</code> section contains the line <code>"@vocab": "https://schema.org/"</code>, so the key "color" is expanded to "https://schema.org/color." (note that the slash after "https://schema.org" is necessary; otherwise the key will concatenate to "https://schema.orgcolor." Make sure to always include the delimiter at the end when using this strategy!)</p>

                <p>After using these techniques, our new semantic triple will be "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">My car</span> <span class="sr-only">Subject</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">https://schema.org/color</span> <span class="sr-only">Object</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">silver</span> <span class="sr-only">Predicate</span>." A JSON-LD file holding this triple might look like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
    },
    "color": "silver"
}</code></pre>

                <p>In this case, you would have to know that this is metadata describing my car&mdash;maybe the file is named "myCar.jsonld."</p>

                <p>We can also define a URI for the subject of the triple. Since there isn't a URI for my personal car, we're going to look at <a href="https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/">a SatNOGS observation</a> for the rest of the examples. We want to make a JSON-LD file to store the triple "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">This specific observation</span><span class="sr-only">Subject</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">has ground station</span><span class="sr-only"> Object</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">1378 - Wolbach Library</span><span class="sr-only">Predicate</span>." MetaSat has a URI for the concept "has ground station": https://schema.space/metasat/groundStation. In addition, the observation has a unique URL: https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/. How do we store the URL for the subject using JSON-LD?</p>

                <p>There is a special concept that can be used with JSON-LD to store the identifier for the subject: <code>@id</code>. <code>@id</code> can ONLY store URIs for its value. If anything else is stored in the value of <code>@id</code>, it will be expanded using the base vocabulary. Using <code>@id</code> to store the URI, our JSON-LD file for the observation will look like this (notice that the base vocabulary was changed to "https://schema.space/metasat/"):</p>

<pre><code>{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://schema.space/metasat/"
    },
    "@id": "https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/",
    "groundStation": "1378 - Wolbach Library"
}</code></pre>

                <p>Now the machine-readable RDF triple is "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/</span> <span class="sr-only">Subject</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">https://schema.space/metasat/groundStation</span> <span class="sr-only">Object</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">1378 - Wolbach Library</span> <span class="sr-only">Predicate</span>."</p>

                <p>What if we want to use concepts that are not in the MetaSat vocabulary? You can also include other vocabularies by creating aliases for their base URLs and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE">CURIEs</a>. For example, the <code>@context</code> section could include the line <code>"schema": "https://schema.org/"</code>; then, a key such as "schema:Person" would expand to "https://schema.org/Person."</p>

                <p>Now we can easily add another triple using schema.org's "Identifier" predicate. This JSON-LD file will look like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://schema.space/metasat/",
        "schema": "https://schema.org/"
    },
    "@id": "https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/",
    "schema:identifier": "2243157",
    "groundStation": "1378 - Wolbach Library"
}</code></pre>

                <p>Just like plain JSON, JSON-LD can be used to nest information to make it look more hierarchical. JSON-LD isn't inherently hierarchical, but nesting can help make files more human-readable. Right now, the ground station is an object with respect to the observation, but we can also include triples where the ground station is a subject. We can use <code>@id</code> to make the ground station's URI a subject, then add another predicate and object. For example, maybe we want to add a triple that says "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">This ground station</span> <span class="sr-only">Subject</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">has name</span> <span class="sr-only">Object</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">1378 - Wolbach Library</span> <span class="sr-only">Predicate</span>." The file would look like:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "@context": {
        "@vocab": "https://schema.space/metasat/",
        "schema": "https://schema.org/"
    },
    "@id": "https://network.satnogs.org/observations/2243157/",
    "schema:identifier": "2243157",
    "groundStation": {
        "@id": "https://network.satnogs.org/stations/1378/",
        "schema:name": "1378 - Wolbach Library"
    } 
}</code></pre>

                <p>Note that curly braces are used to denote a new JSON-LD object. The new triple, in machine-readable form, is "<span class="subject font-weight-bold">https://network.satnogs.org/stations/1378/</span> <span class="sr-only">Subject</span> <span class="predicate font-italic">https://schema.org/name</span> <span class="sr-only">Object</span> <span class="object font-weight-bold font-italic">1378 - Wolbach Library</span> <span class="sr-only">Predicate</span>."</p>

                <p>If you are wondering how to get from the human-readable keys to machine-readable URIs, this happens after using JSON-LD's transformation algorithms.
